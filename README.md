# Overview
Python version of `ProteinGymR` package. This provide analysis-ready data resources from ProteinGym, generated by Notin et al., 2023. 
ProteinGym comprises a collection of benchmarks for evaluating the performance of models predicting the effect of point mutations. 
This package provides access to two datasets: 
1. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) scores from 217 assays measuring the impact of all possible amino acid substitutions across 186 proteins, and 
2. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores for ~1.6 M substitutions in the ProteinGym DMS data.


# Installation
To install the software, we recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) for python management:

```
uv venv --python=3.13  #create a venv
source .venv/bin/activate 
uv pip install git+https://github.com/ccb-hms/ProteinGymPy.git#egg=ProteinGymPy
```

# Usage

Currently only one function `get_dms_substitution_zip` is available, run the example with `main.py`

```
source .venv/bin/activate && python main.py
Downloading https://zenodo.org/records/15293562/files/DMS_ProteinGym_substitutions.zip to .cache/DMS_ProteinGym_substitutions.zip...
Download complete.
```
