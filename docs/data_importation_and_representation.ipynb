    "\n",
    "Predicting the effects of mutations in proteins is critical to many\n",
    "applications, from understanding genetic disease to designing novel proteins to\n",
    "address our most pressing challenges in climate, agriculture and healthcare.\n",
    "Despite an increase in machine learning-based protein modeling methods,\n",
    "assessing the effectiveness of these models is problematic due to the use of\n",
    "distinct, often contrived, experimental datasets and variable performance across\n",
    "different protein families.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ProteinGym](https://proteingym.org/) is a large-scale and holistic set of\n",
    "benchmarks specifically designed for protein fitness prediction and design\n",
    "curated by @Notin2023.\n",
    "It encompasses both a broad collection of over 250 standardized deep mutational\n",
    "scanning (DMS) assays, spanning millions of mutated sequences, as well as\n",
    "curated clinical datasets providing high-quality expert annotations about\n",
    "mutation effects. Furthermore, ProteinGym reports the performance of a diverse\n",
    "set of over 70 high-performing models from various subfields (eg., mutation\n",
    "effects, inverse folding) into a unified benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "ProteinGym datasets are publicly available as a community resource both on\n",

    "1.  DMS assay scores from 217 assays measuring the impact of all possible amino\n",

    "\n",
    "3.  Reference file containing metadata associated with the 217 DMS assays, such\n",
    "    as taxon, protein sequence length, UniProt ID, etc. with `get_dms_metadata()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Five model performance metrics (\"AUC\", \"MCC\", \"NDCG\", \"Spearman\",\n",
    "    \"Top_recall\") for 79 models across 217 assays calculated on DMS\n",
    "    substitutions in a zero-shot setting. The data can be obtained with\n",

    "5.  Model scores on the DMS substitutions for 79 models in the zero-shot\n",

    "6.  Two model performance metrics (\"Spearman\", and \"MSE\") for 12 models across\n",
    "    217 assays calculated on DMS substitutions in a semi-supervised setting. Load in this data with `get_supervised_metrics()`.\n",
    "\n",

    "    folding schemes: contiguous, modulo, and random. Loaded in with\n",
    "    `get_supervised_substitution_data()` and by changing the \"fold_scheme\" argument,\n",

    "performance across several variant effect prediction models when using the \n",
    "DMS data as ground truth. This function takes in one of the five\n",
    "available metrics, and and compares the performance of up to 5 out of the \n",
    "79 available models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the zero-shot setting, the effects of mutations on fitness are predicted \n",
    "without relying on ground-truth labels for the protein of interest. \n",
    "Robust zero-shot performance is particularly informative when labels are\n",
    "subject to several biases or scarcely available (e.g., labels for rare genetic\n",
    "pathologies).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance was evaluated across 5 metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (default metric)\n",
    "2.  Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)\n",
    "3.  Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), most suitable for bimodal DMS \n",
    "measurements\n",
    "4.  Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gains (NDCG)\n",
    "5.  Top K Recall (top 10% of DMS values)\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the fact that certain protein functions are overrepresented \n",
    "in the list of proteins assayed with DMS (e.g., thermostability), these metrics \n",
    "were first calculated within groups of proteins with similar functions. The \n",
    "final value of the metric is then the average of these averages, giving each \n",
    "functional group equal weight. The final values are referred to as the \n",
    "'corrected average'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the often non-linear relationship between protein function and organism\n",
    "fitness, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is typically an appropriate choice for \n",
    "evaluating model performance against experimental measurements. However, in \n",
    "situations where DMS measurements exhibit a bimodal profile, rank correlations \n",
    "may not be the optimal choice. Therefore, additional metrics are also provided, \n",
    "such as the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and the Matthews Correlation \n",
    "Coefficient (MCC), which compare binarized model scores and experimental \n",
    "measurements. Furthermore, for certain goals (e.g., optimizing functional \n",
    "properties of designed proteins), it is more important that a model is able to \n",
    "correctly identify the most functional protein variants, rather than properly \n",
    "capture the overall distribution of all assayed variants. For such scenarios, \n",
    "it is beneficial to use the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gains (NDCG) which \n",
    "prioritizes models that return high scores for sequences with high DMS value \n",
    "(corresponding to strong gain in fitness). Alternatively, the Top K Recall \n",
    "(with K being set to the top 10% of DMS values) can also be informative for such \n",
    "scenarios.\n",
